In this file, we will briefly talk about what we've accomplished.


# Frontend
 1. We have found a library(@ant-design-pro) which we think is modifiable and can be used by our Gator Forum.
 2. We have set English as default language.
 3. After login, user profile page is set as default page at present. But later, we will change this default page as the main page of our forum.
 4. Loading page and login page have been modified.







# Backend
 1. We desigend database tables and modified some of them to reduce some data redundancy.
 2. We implemented gin web framework of Golang for the backend and successfully connected to the database.
 3. For this demo, we developed Admin model and User model.
