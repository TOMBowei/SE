In this file, we will briefly talk about what we've accomplished.


# Frontend
 1. We have found a template which we think is modifiable and can be used by our Gator Forum.
 2. We have done some translating work and some vocabularies are changed to make them more suitable to our forum.








# Backend
 1. We desigend database tables and modified some of them to reduce some data redundancy.
 2. We implemented gin web framework of Golang for the backend and successfully connected to the database.
 3. For this demo, we developed Admin model and User model.
